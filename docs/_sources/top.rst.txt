txtoflow (Translate To Flowchart)
=================================

The Python library can be used to generate flowcharts from pseudo-code.

Installation
------------

You may need to install the following graphviz tools and libraries first

On Ubuntu ...

.. code::

   sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config

Then

.. code::

   pip install txtoflow

Usage
-----

.. code:: python3

   from txtoflow import txtoflow

   txtoflow.generate(
       '''
       if (A) {
           B;
       } else {
           C;
           D;
           while (E) {
               F;
           }
           G;
       }
       H;
       '''
   )

Will generate an image named ``flowchart.jpg`` in current dir that looks like below

.. image:: ../../examples/flowchart.jpg

All the conditions and states can be arbitrary strings too

.. code:: python3

   from txtoflow import txtoflow

   txtoflow.generate(
       '''
       First Node;
       if (A != 10) {
           B;
       } else if (Just a String) {
           Another String;
       } else {
           Else Body;
           More Statements;
           while (While also works) {
               While Body;
           }
           Link back;
       }
       Final Node;
       '''
   )

Will still generate image like below

.. image:: ../../examples/strings.jpg

Examples
--------

More examples can be found `here <https://gitlab.com/krishkasula/txtoflow/-/tree/master/examples>`_

Cmdline usage
-------------

.. code:: tcsh

   $ > txtoflow -h

   # Generates flowchart of pseudo-code from sample.c in file flow.jpg
   $ > txtoflow -s sample.c -o flow.jpg
